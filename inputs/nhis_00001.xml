The four regions--Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, and West--correspond to the U.S. regions recognized by the Census Bureau. Divisions and states included in the four regions are as follows:

Northeast:  New England Division (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut) and Middle Atlantic Division (New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania)

North Central/Midwest: East North Central Division (Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin) and West North Central Division (Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Nebraska)

South: South Atlantic Division (Delaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida), East South Central Division (Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Alabama), and West South Central Division (Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana)

West: Pacific Division (Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, and Hawaii) and Mountain Division (Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[NHISPID is an IPUMS NHIS-constructed value that is an identifying number unique to each person in a given survey year.  Using NHISPID, analysts can link IPUMS NHIS data with additional data elements, from the NHIS source public use data files, that are not currently available in IPUMS.  For example, researchers can use NHISPID to link variables in IPUMS NHIS with other variables from the core NHIS files variables.  Alternatively, users may use NHISPID to link variables from IPUMS with variables from NHIS supplements that are not yet part of IPUMS NHIS. NHISPID is a single variable constructed by concatenating multiple data elements from the NHIS source data files.  

Analysts wishing to link household-level NHIS data should use the household-level linking key NHISHID.

      <labl>Medical care delayed due to cost, past 12 months</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[DELAYCOST indicates whether, during the past twelve months, individuals delayed seeking medical care because of worry about the cost.  For 1997 forward, respondents were told not to include dental care when answering this question.

 The Field Representative's Manual for 1993 forward noted, "Delayed assumes that medical care has been or will eventually be received."  This definition of the term was not routinely shared with respondents.

Related Variables

Several other variables available for 1997 forward address reasons other than "worry about the cost" that caused sample adults and sample children to delay getting medical care.  The non-financial reasons for delays in getting medical care identified in these variables are:  "you couldn't get an appointment soon enough" (DELAYAPPT); "the clinic/doctor's office wasn't open when you could get there" (DELAYHRS); "you couldn't get through on the telephone" (DELAYPHONE); "you didn't have transportation" (DELAYTRANS); and "once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor" (DELAYWAIT). 

Available for 1997 forward, YBARCARE, which identifies individuals who needed but did not get medical care because they could not afford it during the past 12 months, covers some of the same ground as DELAYCOST.  However, the wording of the question for YBARCARE implies that medical care was foregone for financial reasons, while the wording of the question for DELAYCOST refers to care delayed for financial reasons.  The difference in these two variables may, however, be less than is implied by this semantic distinction.  In the case of some acute illnesses (such as respiratory infections and "stomach flu"), medical care that was delayed was doubtless ultimately foregone in many cases.

For 1997 forward, the survey also collected information about whether, at any time during the past twelve months, sample adults and sample children needed but did not get specific types of medical care because they could not afford it.  The specific types of medical care foregone for financial reasons that the survey identified were mental health care or counseling (YBARMENTAL, prescription medicines (YBARMEDS), eyeglasses (YBARGLASS), dental care, including check-ups (YBARDENTAL, available for 1999 forward), follow-up care (YBARFOLLOW, available for 2011 forward), and specialist care (YBARSPECL, available for 2011 forward).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults whom a doctor or other health professional had ever diagnosed as having coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIEV), CHEARTDIYR reports answers to the question, "During the past 12 months, have you had coronary heart disease?"

Coronary heart disease was not defined in the survey documentation.  The Medline Plus Medical Encyclopedia defines coronary heart disease as follows: "Coronary heart disease (or coronary artery disease) is a narrowing of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart (coronary arteries).  Coronary disease usually results from the build-up of fatty material and plaque (atherosclerosis).  As the coronary arteries narrow, the flow of blood to the heart can slow or stop.  The disease can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, heart attack, or other symptoms.  Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women."

Related Variables

In 2002 and 2007, the survey identified sample adults who had other forms of heart disease during the past 12 months, including angina pectoris (ANGIPECYR), a heart attack or myocardial infarction (HEARTATYR), or any other kind of heart condition or heart disease (other than coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, or heart attack) (HEARTCONYR).  Respondents for these inquiries were limited to those whom a doctor or other health professional had ever diagnosed as having the corresponding heart condition (ANGIPECEV, HEARTATTEV, and HEARTCONEV).   Also in 2002, the survey identified sample adults who had congestive heart failure during the past 12 months (CONHFAILYR), again limiting the inquiry to those sample adults who had ever been diagnosed with this condition (CONHFAILEV).  

The 1977 survey included a single, broad question covering all types of heart disease or heart trouble during the past 12 months.  Specifically, persons age 20 and older were asked, "During the past 12 months, did you have heart disease or heart trouble?" (HEARTDISYR).

      <txt><![CDATA[DIABETICEV identifies sample children and sample adults who had ever been diagnosed with "diabetes or sugar diabetes" by a doctor or other health professional.

The format of the questions about diabetes differed for children and adults.  For children, respondents were shown a flashcard listing several chronic conditions (including diabetes) and asked, "Looking at this list, has a doctor or health professional ever told you that [person] had any of these conditions?"  For adults, the question was, "Have you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?"  For women, the question was preceded by the phrase, "Other than during pregnancy" (to exclude cases of gestational diabetes present only during pregnancy).

The range of responses recognized also differed for children and adults.  For children, responses were a dichotomous yes and no (or mentioned and not mentioned).  For adults, there was a third option, "Borderline."  Borderline diabetes was not defined in the survey documentation, but outside sources indicate this term refers to "impaired glucose tolerance" or "impaired fasting glucose."  In recent years, the term "pre-diabetes" has increasingly displaced the term "borderline diabetes."

Definitions of Diabetes

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 states, "Do not include self-diagnosed diabetes, pre-diabetes, high sugar, or any condition other than 'diabetes' or 'sugar diabetes.'  Do NOT include a doctor's diagnosis of 'gestational diabetes' or diabetes present only when a woman is pregnant."  These directions were not routinely read to respondents and were contradicted by the survey form itself, with its inclusion of the "borderline" option (which overlaps with "pre-diabetes" and "high sugar").

Beginning in 2001, the Manual included the following definition of diabetes: "Diabetes is a chronic disorder of carbohydrate metabolism involving insulin.  Symptoms include elevated sugar in the urine and the blood, excessive urination, thirst, hunger, weight loss, and itching."  This definition was not routinely shared with respondents.


Other Diabetes-Related Variables

Some diabetes-related variables, such as DIABETICEV, were included in the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) every year, beginning in 1997.  From 1997 forward, the NHIS included questions about age at first diagnosis of diabetes (DIABETICAGE) for adult respondents who reported a diabetes diagnosis (other than "borderline.")  Similarly, beginning in 1997, the survey consistently asked whether persons ever diagnosed with diabetes were now taking insulin (INSULIN) or were now taking diabetic pills (DIAPILLS).  

Other diabetes-related questions were periodically included in the survey, particularly in 1999 and 2003.  The Manual for 2003 reported that the additional diabetes questions in that year were sponsored by the National Institute(s) of Health.
  
One group of the "periodic" diabetes questions collect further information on the time elapsed since first diagnosis of the illness.  These include:
  
Years since first diagnosed with diabetes (DIAYRSAGO, in 1999-2005) 
Diabetes diagnosed in past 12 months (DIAGNOSYR, in 1999) 
Months ago, within year, diabetes diagnosed (DIAGNOSYRMO, in 1999) 

A second group of "periodic" diabetes variables relate to the hemoglobin A1C test, a blood test which provides information about how high an individual's blood sugar level has been over the past 3 months.  These variables include:

Ever heard of hemoglobin A1C (DIA1CKNOW in 1999, 2003) 
Number exams for A1C hemoglobin, past 12 months (DIA1CEXAMYR, in 1999, 2003)
Last A1C hemoglobin level (DIA1CLEVEL, in 2003)
Safe A1C hemoglobin level, according to doctor (DIA1CSAFE, in 2003) 

A third group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables focus on the frequency of checking blood glucose levels.  These variables include:

Times per day check blood for glucose (DIAGLUCDAY, in 2003)
How often check blood for glucose: Time period (DIAGLUCTP, in 2003) 
How often check blood for glucose: Number of units (DIAGLUCNO, in 2003) 

A fourth group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables are concerned with the frequency of checking for foot sores.  These variables include:

Number exams for foot sores, past 12 months (DIAFTEXAMYR, in 1999, 2003)
Times per week check feet for sores (DIAFTEXAMWK, in 2003)
How often check feet for sores: Time period (DIAFTEXAMTP, in 2003)
How often check feet for sores: Number of units (DIAFTEXAMNO, in 2003) 

A fifth group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables relate to eye examinations and eye diseases linked to diabetes.  These variables include:

Months since last eye exam with pupils dilated (DIAEYEXAMO, in 1999, 2002-2003)
Ever told had diabetic retinopathy (DIARETINEV, in 2002) 
Had diabetic retinopathy, past 12 months (DIARETINYR, in 2002)

The last group of "periodic" diabetes-related variables concern contact with health professionals for the treatment and management of diabetes.  These variables include:

Seeing one doctor for diabetes (DIAONEDR, in 2003) Number times saw doctor for diabetes, past 12 months (DIADRYRNO, in 2003) 
Number times saw nurse/dietician for diabetes, past 12 months
(DIANURSYRNO, in 2003) 
Ever took class in diabetes management (DIACLASS, in 1999)

      <txt><![CDATA[HEARTCONEV identifies sample adults whom a doctor or other health professional ever diagnosed as having any kind of heart condition or disease other than coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, or a heart attack (myocardial infarction).   In the 2002 and 2007 surveys, persons who acknowledged ever being diagnosed with any kind of heart disease other than coronary heart disease, angina pectoris, or a heart attack were asked whether they had this condition during the past 12 months (HEARTCONYR).

The Field Representative's Manual for 1997-2000 specifies some of the conditions that might be included under this heading: "Include as heart disease or heart condition any of the following: heart failure, chronic heart condition, rheumatic heart disease, atrial or mitral valve disease damage, etc."  

Related Variables

In 1997 and subsequent years, the survey collected information from sample adults about a number of specific conditions related to heart disease.  In 1997 forward, sample adults were asked whether they were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that they had angina pectoris (ANGIPECEV).  Sample adults were also consistently asked whether they had ever been diagnosed with a heart attack or myocardial infarction (HEARTATTEV) or with coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIEV).  In 2002 and 2007, follow-up questions for those giving affirmative answers covered whether sample adults had angina pectoris (ANGIPECYR), a heart attack (HEARTATYR), or coronary heart disease (CHEARTDIYR) during the past 12 months.  The 1999 survey collected information on age when first diagnosed with a heart attack (HEARTATAGE). 

In 1999 and 2002, the survey collected information on whether sample adults were ever diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CONHFAILEV) and, in 2002, about whether they had congestive heart failure during the past 12 months (CONHFAILYR).

The 1977 survey included a single, broad question covering all types of heart disease or heart trouble.  Specifically, persons age 20 and older were asked, "During the past 12 months, did you have heart disease or heart trouble?" (HEARTDISYR).

For sample children, from 1997 forward, information was collected on whether the child was ever diagnosed with congenital heart disease (CONGHARTEV) or with some other (non-congenital) heart condition (NONCONHARTEV).

In 1977, this information was collected for all persons age 20 and older; in 2002 and 2007, it was collected only from sample adults age 18+ who were ever diagnosed by a doctor or other health professional as having hypertension (HYPERTENEV); in 2012 sample children ages 6-17 were also included.  Please see the Comparability and Universe tabs for changes in the universe between samples.

The notes in the Codebook for 1977 state that these data "were collected for classification purposes only and not to ascertain prevalence estimates."

In 2002 and 2007, respondents who received the question associated with HYPERTENYR were also asked about whether they were ever told on two or more different visits that they had hypertension (HYP2TIME).]]></txt>

      <txt><![CDATA[For sample adults aged 18 and older who have ever been told by a doctor/other health professional that they had a weakened immune system, IMSPCHC reports whether the respondent currently has a health condition that a doctor or other health professional told him/her that it would weaken the immune system, even without related medications or treatments. Examples include certain kinds of leukemia, lymphoma, or HIV infection.

This variable is part of the Adult Immunosuppression (AIS) section which consists of seven questions sponsored by the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD, CDC). The purpose of the questions is to estimate the number and percentage of adults with weakened immune systems--both lifetime (IMSUPEV) and current (IMSPSL)--and to ask about possible reasons for their immune compromised state (i.e., from medications (IMSPMED), chronic illnesses or serious health conditions (IMSPCHC, IMSPSHC), cancer (IMSPCAN), or repeated infections or colds (IMSPCLD).

      <labl>Smoke every day, some days, or not at all</labl>
      <txt><![CDATA[SMOKFREQNOW reports the responses to the question, "Do you NOW smoke cigarettes every day, some days or not at all?" This question was asked of sample adults who reported having ever smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire lifetime (SMOKEV) and for 1991 and 1992, had a known response for whether they currently smoked. 

Definitions and Instructions

The 1997-2000 Field Representative's Manuals stated, "The questions in this section concern cigarette smoking only. Accept whatever the Sample Adult reports, except if it is volunteered that he/she smoked a pipe, cigars of any kind, marijuana, hashish, 'crack', or the like." The Manuals for 2001 forward define a cigarette as "anything the respondent reports except cigars or any kind of marijuana."  The 1991 and 1992 had approximately the same definition. 

Specifically concerning the question associated with SMOKFREQNOW, the Manuals for 1997-2000 instructed interviewers, "If the sample adult gives an answer which does not match the categories read in the question, reread the question emphasizing the wording of the answer categories."


Related Variables

In 1970, 1987, 1992,  and 1997 forward respondents were asked about the age at which they first started smoking "fairly regularly" (SMOKAGEREG).

Depending on their response in SMOKFREQNOW (Smoke every day, some days, or not at all), respondents were also able to receive one or more of the following questions in 1991-1995 and from 1997 forward:

"On the average, how many cigarettes do you now smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY1)
"On how many of the past 30 days did you smoke a cigarette?" (CIGDAYMO)
"On the average, when you smoked during the past 30 days, about how many cigarettes did you smoke a day?" (CIGSDAY2)

The variable CIGSDAY (Average number of cigarettes smoked per day: Current Smokers) is available for 1970, 1974, 1976-1977, 1985, and 1997 forward.
